# Implementation plan — aether-ai-providers

**Current status:** Phase 0, documentation only. No application code has been started.

## Phase 0 — design gate

- [ ] Review purpose, non-goals, architecture, and dependency contracts.
- [ ] Record unresolved decisions in an ADR with options and consequences.
- [ ] Complete threat review, privacy/retention policy, and license/dependency review.
- [ ] Define the public API/event schema and compatibility policy.
- [ ] Define unit, contract, integration, negative, and smoke tests.

## Phase 1 — minimum viable component

Define adapter interface, capability matrix, credential boundary, provider conformance tests, and licensing per SDK.

- [ ] Implement only this repository's owned responsibility; reuse stable interfaces rather than copying adjacent modules.
- [ ] Add typed configuration validation, safe defaults, structured redacted logging, and correlation IDs.
- [ ] Add unit tests and contract tests using mocks/fixtures before live provider calls.

## Phase 2 — integration

- [ ] Integrate through the documented interface with the direct upstream dependency.
- [ ] Test unauthorized access, malformed input, timeouts, dependency outages, cancellation, duplicate requests, and partial failures.
- [ ] Update the master dependency graph and API docs if a contract changes.

## Phase 3 — release gate

- [ ] Lint/format, typecheck, tests, build, dependency/license scan, and secret scan pass.
- [ ] Documentation reflects the tested behavior and current version.
- [ ] Migration/rollback steps exist for persistent state or deployment changes.
- [ ] Review confirms no secrets, real user data, or production-only configuration is committed.

## Definition of done

A feature is complete only when implementation, tests, security review, operational notes, and cross-repository contracts agree. Creating a repository or compiling code alone is not completion.
