# Work log — aether-ai-providers

## 2026-10-22 — Documentation foundation

- Added repository purpose, project specification, architecture, dependency/contract policy, implementation gates, and research/license notes.
- No application source code, production configuration, infrastructure, or deployment was added.
- Reason: Aether AI is planned as a 33-repository ecosystem. Clear ownership and interfaces must be agreed before coding to prevent duplicate responsibilities, circular dependencies, and unsafe cross-service calls.
- Research references include the official AI DIAL repositories, the existing WoHo AI DevKit repository, and MCP documentation where relevant.
- Next: review this repo's contracts against the master catalog; resolve open choices in ADRs; only then begin the smallest testable implementation.

## Ongoing log format

For each future change, record: date; exact files; why the change is needed; alternatives considered; cross-repository connections affected; tests/evidence; security/privacy impact; known risks; follow-up work.

## Persistent decisions

- Aether AI is a proposed project name; verify GitHub/domain/trademark availability before public branding.
- WoHoTech remains a separate project.
- WoHo AI DevKit is a separate dependency and must not be rewritten as part of Aether AI.
- A planned repository is not automatically a separately deployed service.
- No coding starts until documentation and contracts are reviewed.

## 2026-10-22 — Technical design and navigation

- Added `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` with repository-specific proposed internals, dependency connections, failure cases, and test plan.
- Added `docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md` linking the project-wide code-commenting and engineering rules.
- Updated README documentation links so a new contributor can find the technical design and continuity handoff.
- No application source code was added; all changes in this phase are documentation-only.
