# Repository specification: aether-ai-providers

**Status:** Documentation baseline copied from the Aether AI master specification. Implementation status must be verified separately.

## Mission

Adapters for provider-specific chat, embedding, tool-call, streaming, and model metadata APIs.

## Responsibility boundary

Provider protocol and credential handling only; no product business rules.

## Dependencies and connections

aether-ai-gateway; optionally compatible WoHo DevKit provider interfaces.

## Owned capabilities

Provider conformance interface, capability matrix, secret boundary, error normalization, provider contract tests.

## Must not own

- Responsibilities explicitly assigned to another repository in the master catalog.
- Product UI, provider secrets, or privileged actions outside this repository's boundary.
- Unreviewed direct database access into another component's private schema.
- Unversioned cross-repository APIs or hidden side effects.

## Required public contracts

- A typed/versioned interface with documented inputs, outputs, error cases, limits, and compatibility policy.
- Explicit auth/tenant context where data or actions are user-scoped.
- Correlation/run identifiers and structured, redacted lifecycle events.
- Timeouts, retry behavior, cancellation, idempotency, and partial-failure semantics where applicable.

## Security and privacy

- Treat model output, external APIs, uploaded content, workflow definitions, and MCP responses as untrusted.
- Enforce least privilege and tenant isolation at every data/tool boundary.
- Keep credentials server-side and use the approved secret mechanism; never log tokens or raw secrets.
- Define retention, deletion, payload limits, and redaction before persisting prompts, files, or run results.

## Test plan

- Unit tests for domain rules and input validation.
- Contract tests for every direct upstream dependency.
- Negative tests for unauthorized access, malformed inputs, excessive payloads, and missing capabilities.
- Failure tests for timeouts, dependency outages, retries, duplicate requests, and cancellation.
- Integration/smoke test in a non-production environment before release.

## Implementation gates

1. Finish documentation and resolve open ADRs.
2. Pin and license-check every dependency and selected upstream version.
3. Implement a minimum vertical slice only within this repository's boundary.
4. Add tests, observability, security checks, and operational instructions with the implementation.
5. Update this specification and the master catalog in the same change when contracts or ownership change.
