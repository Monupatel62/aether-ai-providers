# Architecture: aether-ai-providers

**Status:** proposed design, not implemented.

## Role in the system

Contains provider-specific protocol details only; never exposes provider credentials to clients.

## Dependencies

aether-ai-gateway contracts and compatible WoHo AI DevKit provider interfaces.

## Data and control flow

1. A user or upstream service initiates an operation through an authenticated, documented boundary.
2. This component validates shape, scope, limits, and required permissions before work begins.
3. It delegates provider-, storage-, identity-, or execution-specific work to the named dependency rather than copying that responsibility.
4. It emits a correlation/run identifier and structured lifecycle events with sensitive fields redacted.
5. It returns a stable result/error contract; partial, cancelled, timed-out, and retried outcomes are distinguishable.

## Boundary rules

- No circular imports or runtime dependency on downstream consumers.
- Cross-repository communication uses versioned HTTP/OpenAPI, typed package contracts, or documented event envelopes; no direct reads of another service's private tables.
- Secrets remain server-side and are passed only to the component that needs them.
- Treat model output, uploaded files, external connector output, MCP metadata, and workflow definitions as untrusted data.
- Enforce least privilege and tenant isolation at every data access and tool-execution boundary.

## Proposed deployment shape

The first milestone should be a small, testable service/library with one responsibility. Do not split into a separate network service just because a repository exists. Package boundaries and deployment boundaries are different decisions. Prefer a modular runtime first; extract a service only when scaling, isolation, ownership, or operational needs justify it.

## Failure behavior

Document and test timeout, cancellation, retry, duplicate request, dependency outage, malformed upstream response, permission denial, and partial-result cases before production use.
