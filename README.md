# aether-ai-providers

> **Status: Documentation phase.** No application code or production deployment has been started in this repository.

## Purpose

Provider adapters and capability metadata for hosted and self-hosted model APIs.

## Responsibility boundary

Isolates provider-specific request/response formats and credentials from product logic.

## Dependencies

WoHo AI DevKit provider interfaces where compatible; aether-ai-gateway contracts.

## Project rules

- Keep WoHoTech separate; this repository belongs to the new Aether AI project.
- Treat the existing [WoHo AI DevKit](https://github.com/Monupatel62/woho-ai-devkit) as a separate dependency. Do not copy or rewrite it without a reviewed technical reason.
- No implementation starts until the documentation and cross-repository contracts are reviewed.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, user data, or production credentials.
- Public interfaces, security decisions, and non-obvious implementation choices must be documented.

## Before coding

Read the project specification, architecture, contracts, implementation plan, and work log. Update the docs in the same change whenever behavior, an API contract, a dependency, or a security boundary changes.
